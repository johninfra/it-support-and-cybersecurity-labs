# PowerShell Windows Health Check Automation

## Overview

This lab demonstrates the development of a PowerShell automation tool designed to collect and report key Windows system health information. The script automates the gathering of commonly requested troubleshooting data and exports the results to a timestamped report file.

The goal of this project was to strengthen PowerShell scripting skills while creating a practical tool that could be used by Help Desk, Desktop Support, and Systems Administration teams to quickly assess workstation health.

## Business Value

In a production IT environment, technicians frequently gather workstation health information during troubleshooting sessions. This process can be repetitive and time-consuming.

This automation solution provides:

- Faster workstation assessments
- Consistent troubleshooting data collection
- Reduced manual effort
- Standardized reporting
- Improved operational efficiency

---

## Challenges Encountered

During development, several challenges were addressed:

- Retrieving accurate uptime information
- Formatting memory and disk statistics for readability
- Filtering non-relevant network adapters
- Creating clean report output
- Exporting timestamped reports

---

## Lessons Learned

Through this project I gained experience with:

- PowerShell variables
- Conditional logic
- CIM/WMI queries
- Object manipulation
- Data formatting
- Script documentation
- Automation workflows
